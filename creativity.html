           <h4 style="font-family: sans-serif;" title="h1">What is Creativity?</h4>
           <small>
            <p style="line-height: 35px; anchor-name: l1;" >Let’s define creativity.<br><br>

            The creative process is the act of making new connections between old ideas or<br> recognizing relationships between concepts. Creative thinking is 
            not about generating <br>something new from a blank slate, but rather about taking what is already
             present and <br> combining those bits and pieces in a way that has not been done previously.<br><br>
            
            While being creative isn’t easy, nearly all great ideas follow a similar creative process. In<br> 1940, an advertising executive named James Webb Young 
            published a short guide <br>titled, A Technique for Producing Ideas.<br><br>
            
            Young believed the process of creative connection always occurred in five steps. </p></small>
           <br> <h4 style="font-family: sans-serif;">The Creative Process</h4>
           <ol style="font-size: 21px; font-family: serif; line-height: 35px; margin-left: -20px;"  >
            <li><b>Gather new material. </b> At first, you learn. During this stage you focus on 1) learning <br>  specific material directly related to your task and 2) 
              learning general material
               by <br> becoming fascinated with a wide range of concepts.<br></li>
            <li> <b> Thoroughly work over the materials in your mind.</b> During this stage, you examine what you <br>have learned by looking at the facts from different angles and <br>
               experimenting with fitting various ideas together. <br></li>
            <li> <b>Step away from the problem.</b> Next, you put the problem completely out of your <br> mind and go do something else that excites you <br> and energizes you. <br></li>
            <li><b> Let your idea return to you.</b> At some point, but only after you have stopped <br> thinking about it, your idea will come back to you with a flash of insight and <br>
              renewed energy.</li>
           <li> <b>Shape and develop your idea based on feedback.</b> For any idea to succeed, you <br> must release it out into the world, submit it to criticism, and adapt it as needed.</li>
          </ol>
           
          <h4 style="font-family: sans-serif;">Is There Such a Thing as ‘Naturally Creative’?</h4>
        <small> <p style="line-height: 35px;">While we often think of creativity as an event or as a natural skill that some people <br> have and some don’t, 
          researchactually suggests that both creativity and non-<br>creativity are learned.<br><br>

            According to psychology professor Barbara Kerr, “approximately 22 percent of the<br> variance [in creativity] is due to the influence of genes.” 
            This discovery was made by <br>studying the differences in creative thinking between sets of twins.All of this to say,<br> claiming that “I’m just not 
            the creative type” is a pretty weak excuse for avoiding <br>creative thinking. Certainly, some people are primed to be more creative than others.<br> However,
             nearly every person is born with some level of creative skill and the majority<br> of our creative thinking abilities are trainable.</p></small>

             <li>The 15-Minute Routine Anthony Trollope Used to Write 40+ Books: Beginning <br> with his first novel in 1847, Anthony Trollope
               wrote at an incredible pace. Over the <br> next 38 years, he published 47 novels, 18 works of non-fiction, 12 short stories, 2 <br> plays, and an
                assortment of articles and letters.
               Let’s break down why Trollope’s <br> simple strategy allowed the author to be so productive and how we can use it in our <br> own lives.<br><br>
              </li>
               <li>The Weird Strategy Dr. Seuss Used to Create His Greatest Work: In 1960, the <br> founder of Random House publishing
                 firm challenged Dr. Seuss to write an <br> entertaining children’s book using only 50 different words.
                  The result was a little  <br> book called Green Eggs and Ham. Here’s what we can learn from Dr. Seuss… <br><br>
                </li>
                  <li>How Creative Geniuses Come Up With Great Ideas: Best-selling author Markus <br> Zusak estimated that he 
                    rewrote the first part of his popular book “The Book <br>Thief” 150 to 200 times. His work ethic
                     and dedication tell us something crucial<br> about how creative geniuses come up with great ideas.

                <h4 style="font-family: sans-serif;">How to Be Creative <br><br>
                  Step 1: Give yourself permission to create junk</h4>
                <p style="font-size: 21px; line-height: 35px;">
                  In any creative endeavor, you have to give yourself permission to create junk. There is <br>
                   no way around it. Sometimes you have to write 4 terrible pages just to discover that you <br> 
                   wrote one good sentence in the second paragraph of the third page.<br><br>

                    Creating something useful and compelling is like being a gold miner. You have to sift <br>
                     through pounds of dirt and rock and silt just to find a speck of gold in the middle of it <br> 
                     all. Bits and pieces of genius will find their way to you, if you give yourself permission <br> 
                     to let the muse flow.</p>
                   
                    <h4 style="font-family: sans-serif;">  Step 2: Create on a schedule </h4>
                    <p style="font-size: 21px; line-height: 35px;">
                      No single act will uncover more creative genius than forcing yourself to create <br>
                      consistently. Practicing your craft over and over is the only way to become decent at it.<br> 
                      The person who sits around theorizing about what a best-selling book looks like will<br>
                       never write it. Meanwhile, the writer who shows up every day and puts their butt in the <br> 
                      chair and their hands on the keyboard — they are learning how to do the work.<br><br>

                      If you want to do your best creative work, then don’t leave it up to choice. Don’t wake<br> 
                      up in the morning and think, “I hope I feel inspired to create something today.” You<br>  
                      need to take the decision-making out of it. Set a schedule for your work. Genius arrives <br> 
                      when you show up enough times to get the average ideas out of the way.<br></p>
                      <h4 style="font-family: sans-serif;"> Step 3: Finish something </h4>
                      <p style="font-size: 21px; line-height: 35px;">
                        Finish something. Anything. Stop researching, planning, and preparing to do the work <br>
                         and just do the work. It doesn’t matter how good or how bad it is. You don’t need to set <br>
                          the world on fire with your first try. You just need to prove to yourself that you have <br>
                          what it takes to produce something.<br><br>

                        There are no artists, athletes, entrepreneurs, or scientists who became great by half-<br>
                        finishing their work. Stop debating what you should make and just make something.<br></p>
                      <h4 style="font-family: sans-serif;">  Step 4: Stop judging your own work </h4>
                      <p style="font-size: 21px; line-height: 35px;"> 
                        Everyone struggles to create great art. Even great artists.<br><br>

                        Anyone who creates something on a consistent basis will begin to judge their own <br>
                        work. I write new articles every Monday and Thursday. After sticking to that<br> 
                         publishing schedule for three months, I began to judge everything I created. I was <br>
                         convinced that I had gone through every decent idea I had available. My most popular<br>
                          article came 8 months later.<br><br>
                        
                        It is natural to judge your work. It is natural to feel disappointed that your creation isn’t <br>
                        as wonderful as you hoped it would be, or that you’re not getting any better at your <br>
                        craft. But the key is to not let your discontent prevent you from continuing to do the<br>
                         work.<br><br>
                        
                        You have to practice enough self-compassion to not let self-judgement take over. Sure,<br>
                         you care about your work, but don’t get so serious about it that you can’t laugh off <br>
                         your mistakes and continue to produce the thing you love. Don’t let judgment prevent<br>
                          delivery.</p>
                          <h4 style="font-family: sans-serif;">  Step 5: Hold yourself accountable </h4>
                          <p style="font-size: 21px; line-height: 35px;"> 
                            Share your work publicly. It will hold you accountable to creating your best work. It<br>
                             will provide feedback for doing better work. And when you see others connect with <br> 
                             what you create, it will inspire you and make you care more.<br><br>

                            Sometimes sharing your work means you have to deal with  haters and critics. But more<br>
                             often than not, the only thing that happens is that you rally the people who believe the<br>
                              same things you believe, are excited about the same things you are excited about, or<br>
                               who support the work that you believe in — who wouldn’t want that?<br><br>
                            
                            The world needs people who put creative work out into the world. What seems simple<br>
                             to you is often brilliant to someone else. But you’ll never know that unless you choose<br>
                              to share.</p>
                              <h4 style="font-family: sans-serif;"> How to Find Your Creative Genius </h4>
                              <p style="font-size: 21px; line-height: 35px;">Finding your creative genius is easy: do the work, finish something, get feedback, find <br> 
                                ways to improve, show up again tomorrow. Repeat for ten years. Or twenty. Or thirty. <br> <br>

                                Inspiration only reveals itself after perspiration.</p>
